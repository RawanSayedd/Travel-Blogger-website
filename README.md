# Travel-Blogger-website
A new idea for travel bloggers to display more places they have explored through some video slides. A responsive web-page WITHOUT using bootstrap carousel. Only JAVASCRIPT, CSS &amp; HTML
NOTE: some videos have a high quality so they won't be uploaded. However, code works properly with different videos. just change your src in video tag
